# Dosage Sensitivity (expected genetic variation in gene expression V<sup>G</sup>) 

V<sup>G</sup> is used to compared the genic ConSplice metric to dosage sensitivity see in **Figure 2** of the manuscript.

The V<sup>G</sup> values are available in `Supplemental Table S1` from [Mohammadi et al.](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aay0256?). 

Supplemental Table S1 will download as excel *.xlsx* file. The V<sup>G</sup> values used in the ConSplice manuscript are in the excel worksheet named "**VG GTEx (Average, AE)**". 

For convenience, we have downloaded the *.xlsx* Table S1 file, converted the stated above worksheet to a *.txt* file and placed it in the [data](https://github.com/mikecormier/ConSplice-manuscript/tree/main/data) directory of this repo under the file name `Vg.gene_level.ANEVA_tableS1.weighted_harmonic_mean.txt`.
