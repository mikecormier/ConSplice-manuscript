## HGMD Pathogenic Splice Altering variants 

We used the professional version of the [Human Gene Mutation Database (HGMD)](http://www.hgmd.cf.ac.uk/) to download the alternative splicing disease causing mutations (DM). 

Becuase of HGMD's licencing, we are not allowed to share this dataset publiclly. The user downloaded this dataset will need the professional licence to HGMD.

Here we share the SQL query used to download the Splice Altering DM variants used in the ConSplice manuscript. 

These variants are used train and test the ConSpliceML model as seen in **Figure 5**, as well as to train the final ConSpliceML model for use to score variants.
