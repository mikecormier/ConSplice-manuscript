# Splicing Constraint models 

A dedicated GitHub repository exists for the purpose of generating genic or regional splicing constraint models, the Constrained Splicing (ConSplice) model.

The ConSplice command-line interface (CLI) can be found [here](https://github.com/mikecormier/ConSplice).  

The ConSplice CLI consists of two sub-modules.
  - Constraint: A module to develop splicing constraint models.
  - ML: A module to run ConSpliceML.


For more information about the ConSplice CLI see the [ConSplice GitHub](https://github.com/mikecormier/ConSplice) repo. 

Additional information, including steps to create different splicing constraint models, can be found in the README file for the directory hosting various splicing constraint models here: [directory](https://home.chpc.utah.edu/~u1138933/ConSplice/models_of_splicing_constraint/) [README](https://home.chpc.utah.edu/~u1138933/ConSplice/models_of_splicing_constraint/dir_README.md).
